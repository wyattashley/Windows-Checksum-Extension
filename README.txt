Quick utility that I created for download checksums. This adds a expandable context windows to the file explorer and 
allows you to run hashing algorithms on the files through CertUtil. Once a hash is created if one is enter then it will
compare the two otherwise, when nothing is entered, it exits the terminal.

To Install:
1) Change Directory in Reg files to make the folder location
2) Run the Reg file
NOTE YOU MUST KEEP THE Checksum.bat FILE TO WORK

To Uninstall:
1) Delete Registry Keys in [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Checksum]
2) Delete the Directory
